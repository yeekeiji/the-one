# arg $1 = -1 : splits matrix data files of multiple watched nodes 
#   takes as inputs the name of each watched node
#   ex. if you have two watched nodes:
#           sh mExtract.sh -1 dataFile.txt n123 m109
# arg $1 = -2 : assumes the dataFile is of only 1 watched node
#   It grabs only the watched node's matrix values when connecting to a
#   specified destination node. Works for multiple destination nodes too.
#   ex. if you want only the data wrt node named r199
#           sh mExtract.sh -2 dataFile.txt r199
#
# output : filtered version of original dataFile with only rows with matches
#   to specific destination nodes or watchnodes.
#   Output of -1 : nodeName + Mvalues.txt. Ex. r199Mvalues.txt
#   Output of -2 : nodeName + compact.txt. Ex. s122only.txt

# useful for the cluster scenario where we are looking at mutliple nodes
# decouples node data from dumpFile.txt that's generated from HeraDebug Router
